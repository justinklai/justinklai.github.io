Detective was born from a shared hatred between Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa and I for I-novels, a genre popularized in Japan in the early 20th century. The story is heavily based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa’s 'In a Bamboo Grove (1921),' reimagining its central question of what truth really means. Through a series of conflicting accounts, the player is called to weigh motives, perspectives, and subtle details, only to find that certainty may never come. The narrative reflects on how easily perception can be shaped, and how even seemingly clear facts can hide unexpected contradictions.

Detective also explores themes that shaped Akutagawa’s work, including the fragility of human relationships, the weight of mortality, and the societal forces that define and limit individuals. Rather than offering the truth, it presents a space for reflection, asking the player to consider not only what they believe happened, but why they chose to believe it.
