## The Problem on Campus

Losing personal items is a common and frustrating experience at UH Mānoa, and the current process for recovering lost belongings is scattered across offices, bulletin boards, and informal social media posts. Items may be turned in to different buildings such as the Campus Center or the Library, while owners often have no clear way to know where to look. Our project addresses this problem by proposing a centralized, campus-only Lost and Found web application that brings together students, staff, and campus offices into a single, organized system. The goal is to reduce confusion, save time, and increase the likelihood that lost items are successfully returned to their owners.

## How the System Works

The application supports three primary user roles: students and staff, finders, and campus administrators. Students and staff can report lost items by providing descriptions, photos, categories, and last-seen locations, while finders can post found items and indicate where they were turned in. Users receive notifications when potential matches appear, allowing secure communication without exposing personal contact information. Administrators at official drop-off locations verify received items, update their status through the recovery process, and manage duplicate or inappropriate posts. This structured flow ensures that every item moves through a clear and accountable recovery lifecycle.

## Design and Project Scope

For Milestone 1, the project focuses on design, planning, and system organization rather than full backend implementation. This includes detailed page mockups, a data model, and a GitHub project board structured according to IDPM guidelines. Core pages such as the Landing Page, Lost/Found Feed, User Dashboard, Post Item Forms, Recovery Instructions, and Locations Directory are designed to reflect realistic campus use cases. By emphasizing thoughtful user experience and clear system structure early on, the project establishes a strong foundation for future development while demonstrating how software design can directly improve everyday campus life.
