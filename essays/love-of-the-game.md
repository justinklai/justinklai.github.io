Connection, curiousness, creation — these are the traits that make us distinctly human. They drive us to reach beyond survival, to communicate, to explore, and to build. Now we live in an age where anyone, anywhere can build the next wheel or a trillion-dollar company, but I want to make something else: a game. Games are more than entertainment; they are a combination of art, music, logic, and community. Whether it’s a massive multiplayer online world or a simple puzzle on a mobile device, games bring people together. As a software engineer, I hope to gain the skills needed to design systems that balance technical performance with meaningful human engagement — systems that help people enjoy life. To me, games are proof that code can do more than solve problems; it can create joy, build communities, and tell stories.

To achieve this dream, I must strengthen my knowledge in data structures and algorithms, and also expand my skills in programming languages and frameworks used for interactive applications, like C++ for coding in a game engine such as Unity. I would have to learn how to design systems to be able to design a game. Understanding how to work within these engines will be essential in turning creative concepts into fully functioning, polished products. However technical skills alone are not enough. I hope to gain experience working on teams and in project management.

Ultimately, what excites me about software engineering is that it is both creative and logical, both solitary and collaborative. It requires precision but also invites imagination. Tangible ideas are strung from abstract concepts, and I want to reach the point where my limiting factor in making software is my creativity, not my technical ability. The end goal for me is to take any vision and bring it to life, no matter how ambitious it is — to thin the line between imagination and implementation as much as humanly possible.
