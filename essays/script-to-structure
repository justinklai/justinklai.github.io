TypeScript is the first static typing language I have tried and its learning curve is difficult. On top of having to learn JavaScript in a short amount of time, the syntax of TypeScript makes it espically difficult to learn. At first I didn't see the appeal of TS, but after seeing errors in compile-time instead of runtime and the readibility makes troubleshooting and debugging very easy, I can see why TS is better for larger scale projects with a large team. TS feels more fluid and I imagine feels like using a better JavaScript, while Java - the language I am most used to - feels much more structured or formal and is much harder to spot an error in an IDE. 

I can tell TS is an amazing language, the readibility, pointing out errors before even running the algorithm, the user expierence, it is all quite great.  

Athletic software engineering and the WODs are fun.
