# Final Project Idea: Student Resource Swap

## Overview

### The Problem
University students often have extra books, stationery, electronics, or other academic resources that go unused, while other students may struggle to obtain these items due to cost or availability. Currently, there is no centralized platform for students at UH Manoa to safely and efficiently share, lend, or swap these resources. Many opportunities for community building and sustainable practices are therefore missed.

### The Solution
Our proposed solution is **Student Resource Swap**, a web application that enables UH Manoa students to post items they are willing to lend, give away, or swap with other students. Users can browse available resources, filter by category, and communicate securely with each other to arrange exchanges. The platform encourages a culture of sharing, sustainability, and community engagement among students while helping individuals save money and reduce waste.

- **Community Focus:** The application is designed specifically for UH Manoa students, promoting local engagement and collaboration.  
- **Sustainability Impact:** By encouraging reuse and exchange, the app reduces waste and fosters environmentally friendly behavior on campus.

## Mockup Page Ideas
1. **Home Page:** Displays a feed of recently posted resources, with search and filter options by category, availability, and location.  
2. **User Profile Page:** Shows the user’s posted items, active swap requests, and past exchanges.  
3. **Item Posting Form:** Allows users to upload photos, descriptions, and tags for items they want to share.  
4. **Messaging Page:** Secure chat interface for users to coordinate exchanges.  
5. **Swap History Page:** Displays completed swaps, ratings, and feedback from other users.

## Use Case Ideas
1. **Posting an Item:** A student has a used textbook to give away. They upload a photo, enter details, and mark it as “available for swap or donation.”  
2. **Searching for Items:** Another student filters by “textbooks” and “free” to find resources they need.  
3. **Initiating a Swap:** A user sends a swap request via the messaging system, negotiates details, and schedules a pickup.  
4. **Personalized Suggestions:** The system recommends resources based on the user’s past searches, swaps, or classes.

## Beyond the Basics
- **Gamification:** Swap points, badges, and leaderboards motivate users to participate actively.  
- **Trust & Safety:** Users can leave feedback and ratings to build a trustworthy campus network.  
- **Data Insights:** Optional analytics for campus administrators about popular items, resource shortages, or community engagement.
