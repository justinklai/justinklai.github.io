## Experience WODs e.g. E18
I did not use AI during the expirence WODs to make sure I have basic coding fundamentals. I felt that these exercises were meant to simulate exam or interview conditions, where external help would not be available.

## In-class Practice WODs
I used AI during practice WODs to emulate exactly what I would so during In-class WODs.

## In-class WODs
I typically used AI to generate code, check for errors, and help break down the problem. Although, I did manually check everything afterwards.

## Essays
For essays, I used AI mainly as a brainstorming and editing assistant.

## Final project
AI helped save time during debugging, but it sometimes suggested solutions that did not fit the project’s architecture, so human judgment was still required.

## Learning a concept / tutorial
When learning new concepts such as functional programming or testing, AI was very helpful. This significantly improved my understanding and made official documentation easier to read afterward. The benefit was faster comprehension; the cost was the temptation to oversimplify complex ideas.

## Answering a question in class or in Discord
AI helped me phrase clearer responses, but I made sure to internalize the explanation before sharing it.

## Asking or answering a smart-question
I usually ask AI instead of asking a smart-question if possible.

## Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I used AI to generate examples to use as references. However, I still tested the example myself to ensure I understood it.

## Explaining code
AI was helpful when I encountered unfamiliar code: “Explain what this function does line by line.” This improved readability and comprehension, especially in larger files.

## Writing code
I occasionally used GitHub Copilot for boilerplate code. It sped up development, but sometimes produced code that did not follow course conventions, so I had to revise it.

## Documenting code
I simply asked AI to comment my code for me and it saves a lot time.

## Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
AI was very effective here, though it sometimes suggested changes that conflicted with project requirements.

## Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
N/A

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Overall, AI enhanced my learning by reducing friction when encountering new concepts. It improved my problem-solving efficiency and confidence. However, it also required discipline to avoid over-reliance, especially for coding tasks where struggling is part of the learning process.

## IV. Practical Applications Outside ICS 314
Outside this course, I have seen AI used in collaborative projects and real-world scenarios such as hackathons (e.g., HACC). AI helped with rapid prototyping, debugging, and idea validation, making it a practical tool for real-world software engineering challenges.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges included inaccurate or overly generic answers and the risk of dependency. Opportunities include teaching students how to prompt effectively and how to critically evaluate AI output.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional methods, AI-enhanced learning increases engagement and speed of feedback. However, traditional approaches are still essential for deep understanding and long-term retention.

## VII. Future Considerations
In the future, AI could be integrated as an officially supported learning aid, with clear guidelines on ethical and effective use. Improved domain-specific AI models could further enhance software engineering education.

## VIII. Conclusion
AI played a supportive but not dominant role in my ICS 314 experience. When used thoughtfully, it enhanced learning, efficiency, and confidence. I recommend continued, guided integration of AI tools to help students learn more effectively while maintaining academic integrity.
