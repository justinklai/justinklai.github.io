## How did you make your effort estimates?

I made my effort estimates by breaking each issue into the main activities I expected to perform, such as understanding the requirements, planning the approach, implementing the solution, and fixing bugs. I relied on past experience with similar tasks to guide my estimates and adjusted them based on perceived complexity or unfamiliarity. When I had little prior experience with a task, I added extra time to account for learning and uncertainty. Although the estimates were imperfect, they were based on thoughtful judgment rather than random numbers.

## Did estimating in advance provide any benefit?

Estimating in advance was still beneficial even when the estimates were inaccurate. The process forced me to think through the work before starting, which helped uncover hidden complexity and risks early. Estimates also helped with planning my workload by making it easier to decide which issues were realistic to work on in a given time frame. Over time, comparing estimates to actual effort revealed patterns, such as consistently underestimating non-coding work.

## Was tracking actual effort useful?

Tracking actual effort was useful because it provided concrete data about how my time was really spent. I noticed that tasks involving research, debugging, or integration took more time than expected, even when the coding itself was relatively short. This information helped me adjust future estimates and make better decisions about when to stop refining a feature and move on to other tasks.

## How did you track your actual effort?

I tracked coding effort using a VSCode time-tracking extension that recorded active development time, including debugging and integrating AI-generated code. Non-coding effort was tracked manually by recording start and stop times for activities such as planning, research, and documentation. I believe my tracking was reasonably accurate, especially for coding time, although non-coding effort may include small inaccuracies due to context switching.

## Reflection and future improvements

If I were to repeat this process, I would separate coding and non-coding estimates more explicitly from the start and add clearer buffers for tasks involving uncertainty. I would also adopt a more consistent tool for tracking non-coding effort to reduce reliance on manual logging. Overall, the process helped me better understand my work habits and improve my project management skills.

## AI use in effort estimation and tracking

I used ChatGPT to assist with design brainstorming, code generation, and documentation drafts, but not to directly generate effort estimates. Time spent designing prompts, reviewing generated code, debugging, and integrating outputs was counted as coding effort, while AI-assisted documentation and learning were counted as non-coding effort. Most AI-generated outputs required manual edits or verification, and tracking this time helped ensure that AI use did not distort my effort data.
